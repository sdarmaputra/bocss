# Vertical Rhytm #

## What I've learned ##

* It's about repetition in design (for example we used 24 px over and over as our base number)
* Consistency gives powerfull impact even only with a small tweak (for example with our small CSS styles we now have a clean new look of our plain HTML, we just need to be consistent using our base number)
